document.writeln("Welcome to MINY church Today we are going to talk about being a Christian. God tell us we are to follow Him and do what good and kind. If we do this we will live happily, and we’ll show others what’s right. Please turn to Mat 5 13-16 You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men. You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.  So, we see we should be a light to the earth, and we should not lose our flavor! Now what does a Cristian do?  Well let’s read 1 Corinthians 11 1 imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ, so we are to imitate or copy the actions of Jesus Christ! Well what did Jesus Christ do?Well He followed what God says to do, which we can read about in the bible! Like in Exodus 20 1-17 I am not going to read it. Also, Jesus set examples for us. For example, the way we do the Passover, now we don’t kill a lamb. What is the difference between a real Christian and a pagan Christian even if the pagan Christian goes to Church? Well pagans go to Church on the first day Sunday When the bible says we should go on the seventh day Saturday. Let us read Exodus 16 26 Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none. Also, pagans… Don’t keep the Holydays. Let us read Leviticus 23 4-6 These are the feasts of the LORD, holy convocations which you shall proclaim at their appointed times. On the fourteenth day of the first month at twilight is the LORD’s Passover. And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD; seven days you must eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall have a holy convocation, you shall do no customary work on it. But you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD for seven days. The seventh day shall be a holy convocation, you shall do no customary work on it.  There is also more Holydays they do not keep.Instead they keep holidays, and they are not supposed to.")

document.write("Welcome to Miny Church! Today we’re going to talk about Elijah and how he worshiped God. There was a very bad King, and his name was Ahab. He was the ruler of Israel. And he married a very evil woman named Jezebel. She worshiped pagan gods. One of the gods name was Baal. There were 450 prophets of Baal! Elijah wanted to correct them, so he invited them to Mount Carmel to show them who was God! To show God’s power, Elijah told the large crowd I alone am left a prophet of the Lord but Baals prophets are 450 men Elijah continued, How long will you continue to falter between two opinions? If the Lord is God fallow Him but if Baal fallow him God would give convincing proof that he was Israel’s only true God. Elijah told the crowd to choose a bull, and that they could choose one first. And he said to pile up some wood, but to light no fire under it. And Elijah said, Ask Baal to send down fire. they cried out all day, but no fire. And Elijah mimicked them, and he said Cry a little louder, he might not hear you, or maybe he is asleep. So, they cried a little louder, and they started cutting themselves. But, still no fire. So then, Elijah drenched his sacrifice with water. And He called for the one true God to send down fire, and it came! And that day thousands saw the power of the Lord. And for the Israelites punishment he had them executed. So, today we learned how Elijah was super faithful and how we should be like him. And we also (hopefully) learned to never worship any other God but him. I’m not saying that there are any other gods, but hopefully you never worship any other gods. I’m not saying that there are any other gods. Oh, yeah, I forgot, I already said that. Never mind, now bye!")
